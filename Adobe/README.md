- Count set bits in an integer
- Program for Binary To Decimal Conversion
- Check if a given array can represent Preorder Traversal of Binary Search Tree
- Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
- Check if a number is a Palindrome
- Pascal's Triangle
- Trapping Rain Water
- Count Inversions in an array | Set 1 (Using Merge Sort)
- Write an Efficient Function to Convert a Binary Tree into its Mirror Tree
- Find the middle of a given linked list in C and Java
- Merge Sort for Linked Lists
- Print Right View of a Binary Tree
- Reverse Level Order Traversal
- Level order traversal in spiral form
- Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list
- Kâ€™th Smallest/Largest Element in Unsorted Array
- Smallest/highest element in the left/right side (Multiple time asked)
- Stock span problem
- Top View of a bst
- Sort an array by their frequency
- Validate if a given string is numeric.
  Examples: </br>
          "0" => true </br>
          " 0.1 " => true </br>
          "abc" => false </br>
          "1 a" => false </br>
          "2e10" => true </br>
  Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem
